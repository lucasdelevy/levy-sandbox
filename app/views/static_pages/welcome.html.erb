      ようこそ！
      <br>Hello and welcome to my page! :-)
      <br>
      I’ll take this space to talk a little more <b><a href="/who-are-you">about me</a></b> and the <b><a href="/what-have-you-done">projects</a></b> I have been working on.
      <br>
      However, this was mainly developed so I could study some Ruby on Rails and also have fun with Javascript. Since I was gonna do something like that, I might as well make it useful with information about me, right?
      <br>
      So please enjoy the apps and, in the meantime, why not watching a cockroach being controlled remotely?
      It is a thing.
      </p>
